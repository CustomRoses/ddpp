# ddpp - A library of D&D functions for DMing and Playing

ddpp was born out of sheer boredom, and wanting to use the functions of roll20 offline. It currently supports rolling and getting averages from strings, as well as the creation and import/export of variable and character files. These are currently very poorly documented, so should you actually want to use any of this, [email me](mailto:luc@nothome.xyz)



# Install

ddpp currently does not require the installation of any additional packages.
